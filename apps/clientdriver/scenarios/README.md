<!-- Project Ambrose by Imjustchico: A catalog of client-driver scenarios and the repeatable checks each one performs. -->

# Client-driver scenario catalog

The client driver loads one JSON file at a time from this directory. The files
listed below are the repeatable checks that cover the C-03 scenario set. They
share the disposable-account, local-server, and private-capture requirements
described in [the safe-session capture guide](../../../doc/guides/safe-session-capture.md).

## C-03 coverage

| Check | Scenario | What it verifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Idle timeout | [`c39-idle-timeout.json`](./c39-idle-timeout.json) | A bounded `Login.AfkTimeout` closes an idle admitted session and records the server-side AFK disconnect. |
| Ban enforcement | [`c39-ban-enforcement.json`](./c39-ban-enforcement.json) | A console-applied account ban closes the admitted session and produces a refused-login response on the next attempt. |
| Reconnect after refusal | [`c39-reconnect-after-refusal.json`](./c39-reconnect-after-refusal.json) | A wrong password, invalid-login dialog, reconnect action, and successful retry occur in that order. |
| Shutdown notice | [`c39-shutdown-notice.json`](./c39-shutdown-notice.json) | A graceful login-server shutdown emits both the server notice and the client maintenance notice. |

The files retain their original C-39 scenario names because they are also
individual regression checks. This catalog groups them under C-03 without
changing their executable behavior or asserting that a run passed without a
client and local server.

## Login and character select

| Check | Scenario | What it verifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Banned before sign-in | [`c77-banned-login.json`](./c77-banned-login.json) | 2.14's banned account: `account ban` on the login server console before the account first signs in, the server's refusal with AccountBanned, the client choosing GUI_AccountBannedTime and a shot of its dialog, and neither the client's admission nor character select ever logged. |
| AFK on character select | [`c78-afk-character-select.json`](./c78-afk-character-select.json) | 2.15's AFK check: a seeded wizard left on character select past a 150-second `Login.AfkTimeout`, the server's MSG_DISCONNECT_LOGIN_AFK, and the client choosing GUI_ConnectionAFK with no lost-connection message, with shots before the timeout and of the dialog. |
| Idle at the login prompt | [`c79-idle-login-keepalive.json`](./c79-idle-login-keepalive.json) | 1.22's idle check: after a wrong password, the client held at the login retry prompt with `Login.AfkTimeout` raised to 600, through six keepalive cycles each way at a 60-second `Network.KeepAliveInterval`, over five minutes, with the session never closed and the account never authenticated. |

C-78 also requires the game server, which the driver starts; C-77 and C-79 run
against the login server alone.

| Check | Scenario | What it verifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Three wizards listed | [`charselect-three-wizards.json`](./charselect-three-wizards.json) | 3.09: three wizards seeded on one account with `more_wizards`, a level 1 Fire boy, a level 12 Ice girl and a level 25 Storm boy, listed by the server, each chosen in turn and shot under its own name, level and school. |
| Creating at the limit | [`create-at-slot-limit.json`](./create-at-slot-limit.json) | 3.12, 3.15 and 3.16: `Character.MaxPerAccount` at 1 with one wizard seeded, the client's creation flow walked with a shot of each screen, the submitted wizard refused with the reason logged, the client's "Character Creation Failed", and the account still holding one wizard. |
| Deleting a wizard | [`delete-a-wizard.json`](./delete-a-wizard.json) | 3.17: two wizards seeded, the first deleted with the client's own dialog, its word ABRACADABRA typed and its Delete pressed, the row kept with deleted_at set, and after the client restarts and logs in again only the other wizard is listed and shown. |
| A key that cannot be spent | [`attach-bad-key.json`](./attach-bad-key.json) | 4.06: a `db_exec` trigger spoils every key the login server stores, so the game server refuses the MSG_ATTACH the client sends with MSG_ATTACHFAILED, and the client is shot over its login screen. |

## World entry

| Check | Scenario | What it verifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standing in Ravenwood | [`enter-world.json`](./enter-world.json) | A wizard saved in WizardCity/WC_Ravenwood is listed, played and handed its object in MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE, the client loads the zone and says so, the entry chatter is answered, and the session stays up through a keepalive. |
| Announcing and kicking | [`announce-and-kick.json`](./announce-and-kick.json) | The Commons entry, then `server announce` on the game server console, whose text the client shows as a notification and logs as a server message, and `kick` with the wizard's character id, which sends the reason CSR and opens the client's dialog for a disconnect by an administrator. |
| Walking in the Commons | [`enter-the-commons.json`](./enter-the-commons.json) | The same entry for a wizard saved in WizardCity/WC_Hub with no position, placed at the zone's Start, with the fields MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE carried recorded, and a held W that moves the view far more than the same time idle, which is the player controlling the wizard. |
| Walking away and back | [`walk-and-return.json`](./walk-and-return.json) | The Commons entry, a walk with W, then the client quits and is started again under the same guard; the game server writes where the wizard stood as it leaves, and the second login must put the wizard back at exactly that place, which differs from the zone's Start it first stood at. |
| Game-server shutdown and return | [`game-server-shutdown-and-return.json`](./game-server-shutdown-and-return.json) | Stops the game server while a wizard is connected, records the flushed MSG_SERVERSHUTDOWN notice and the client's screen, starts the server again, and requires the wizard to re-enter at the exact previously saved position. |
| Badges and a long frame | [`badges-and-long-frame.json`](./badges-and-long-frame.json) | 3.02, 4.11 and 1.18: the Ravenwood entry with the game server saving the LOGINCOMPLETE Data it sends and decoding it at DEBUG, MSG_BADGES logged and the spellbook's Badges page opened and shot, then `server announce --repeat 16` sends a message of about 32000 bytes in one long frame, which the client logs whole. |
| A wizard's live vitals | [`wizard-stats.json`](./wizard-stats.json) | A level 5 game master enters Ravenwood with seeded health, mana and gold; `.character gold 500` updates the open backpack, two potion uses at different live `Potion.RestoreFraction` values update health, mana and charges, and `.character heal` restores health with the animated update. |
| Learning a spell | [`learn-a-spell.json`](./learn-a-spell.json) | A Fire wizard with an empty spellbook enters Ravenwood; `learn "Fire Cat" <wizard>` on the game server console sends MSG_ADDSPELLTOBOOK and a second learn is refused, the spellbook opened with P is shot on its Fire page before and after, the client is quit and started again and the wizard must enter knowing Fire Cat, and `unlearn` sends MSG_REMOVESPELLFROMBOOK before a last shot. The Spell Deck shows no card for a wizard without a deck, so the Fire page stays empty until 8.10 and 8.11 give it one. |
| Two wizards | [`two-wizards.json`](./two-wizards.json) | The main game-master wizard starts with low health and mana, earns XP, and levels up in the Commons; the server confirms both clients receive MSG_LEVELUP, the companion captures the effect, and the main wizard's character sheet, health and mana show the new level and full vitals. The companion then opens and closes its spellbook while the main client records the icon appearing and clearing, turns to face the main wizard, runs a circle with W and D held together, stops and jumps while the main client is filmed every quarter second, then quits and comes back and must be taken away from the main wizard at once and return with a new mobile id as one wizard, not a ghost. |
| Speaking and emoting | [`say-and-emote.json`](./say-and-emote.json) | Two wizards as in two-wizards.json, the companion showing its chat box: the main wizard types hello, which its client sends as the menu phrase Hello that waves, then a typed line the companion sees as a bubble and a chat log line under the main wizard's own name, and `.help`, which nobody is shown. From the quick chat menu it picks Yes, then Hi from the Hello/Goodbye category while the companion is filmed waving. `Chat.SayRange` and `GM.CommandPrefix` changed on the game server console apply from the next line. |
| Game master commands in chat | [`gm-commands-in-chat.json`](./gm-commands-in-chat.json) | The main account is made a game master on the login server's console, and two wizards enter the Commons. The game master's `.help` runs and its command list comes back in its chat window, while the companion, a player, sees no bubble. The companion's own `.help` is said as a line, then refused once `GM.PlayerCommandsAsChat` is off. With `GM.LogCommands` off a command still answers but is not logged, and the next command after it is back on is. |
| Link-dead expiry | [`two-wizards-link-dead-expiry.json`](./two-wizards-link-dead-expiry.json) | Includes the two-wizard reattach check, then ends the resumed companion's process again and verifies the main wizard receives its removal after the 300-second link-dead window. |
| Menu logout | [`two-wizards-menu-logout.json`](./two-wizards-menu-logout.json) | Includes the two-wizard and link-dead reattach checks, then chooses Quit in the companion's in-world menu, verifies immediate removal and saved position, stops the client's retry of its spent zone ticket, and requires a fresh login at that exact position. |
| Return to character select | [`return-to-select.json`](./return-to-select.json) | The Ravenwood entry of enter-world.json, a walk with W, then Quit from the in-world menu; the client validates its stored session key with MSG_USER_VALIDATE and lands on character select with no password typed, the wizard is offline with its zone saved and gone from `realm_online_character`, and Play puts it back at the exact place the game server wrote, in 5.06. |

All world-entry scenarios require the game server as well as the login server; the driver starts them. A step names the client it drives with `"client": "companion"`, `kill_client` ends that client's process without its logout path, `stop_game_server` and `start_game_server` bracket a graceful game-server restart, `hold_key` holds a list of keys together, `play` hands the client to whoever is at the machine and holds the run, servers and databases up until the client window is closed, which play.json uses to put a level 25 Fire wizard in the Commons for the maintainer, and a held key or a press may `watch` the other client, which is filmed every `watch_every` seconds while the key is held or the press made and for `watch_after` seconds after.

## Patching

| Check | Scenario | What it verifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No patch connection with -P 0 | [`patch-off.json`](./patch-off.json) | The launcher's client, started with `-P 0` from a run folder holding the install's own `PatchConfig.xml` pointed at a live local listener, shows the login window and logs in while that listener and one on 12500 see no connection and the guard sees nothing off the machine, with no patcher line in the client's log. |
| The default without -P | [`patch-default.json`](./patch-default.json) | The client started from the launcher's own prepared command with only `-P 0` taken out, so it follows its own default, with the install's own `PatchConfig.xml` in its folder pointed at a local listener; the client connecting to that listener shows it contacts the patch host its configuration names by default, while the guard keeps every connection on this machine and the install check proves nothing on disk changed. |

## Launcher

| Check | Scenario | What it verifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Play from the launcher window | [`launcher-window-play.json`](./launcher-window-play.json) | 3.26: the launcher opened with `--window-ui` shows the run's server as host:port, the client's revision, the window size and the login server Online on its ready screen and the install the driver found, `{install}`, on its settings screen, read through UI Automation, then its Play, pressed by its accessible name, starts the client as the launcher's child with a client area of the run's window size, and the client reaches its login window. |

`launch: "window"` cannot be combined with `patching: "default"`, a companion
or `restart_client`, because the window starts one client and only its Play
starts it.

## Listing and running

List the scenarios without starting a client or server:

```powershell
python apps\clientdriver\drive.py scenarios
```

Run one check with a user-owned client, locally built binaries, and a run
directory outside the repository:

```powershell
python apps\clientdriver\drive.py run `
  --scenario c39-idle-timeout.json `
  --binaries C:\Path\To\Ambrose\bin `
  --client C:\Path\To\Your\Client `
  --runs C:\Temp\ambrose-clientdriver
```

Replace the scenario name for the other rows. The run directory contains the
private report, logs, and (unless `--no-capture` is explicitly selected) the
private `login.pcapng` and `.tshark.txt` files. Do not copy those artifacts
into this directory or into the repository.

## Boundaries

- These scenarios require the driver preflight to succeed; an unavailable
  client, capture adapter, or required helper is a prerequisite limitation,
  not a failed protocol assertion.
- The scenario runner creates its disposable account and scratch databases
  according to the selected server options. Do not provide a real account or
  a production database.
- A scenario's recorded logs and capture remain private. Public reports may
  cite only non-sensitive metadata such as the scenario name, result, frame
  count, and failure step.
